# Basics: Programming Projects in Python

This repository contains a collection of basic Python projects aimed at beginners. These projects cover a range of fundamental concepts, such as mathematical operations, GUI development with `tkinter`, and problem-solving techniques. 

## Projects Included

1. **Grading System**: A program that calculates a student's final grade based on weighted percentages.
2. **Temperature Conversion**: Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
3. **Binary Operations**: Perform addition on binary numbers, and convert between binary, decimal, and octal.
4. **Font Style Changer**: Change the font style of a text with an option button.
5. **Bitwise Calculator**: Perform basic bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Shift).
6. **Number Comparison**: Determine the lowest or highest number between four inputs.
7. **Text Validation**: Input validation for accepting only letters or numbers in a textbox.
8. **Name Reversal**: A program that prints a name in reverse order.
9. **User Info Display**: Display personal information such as full name, birthday, and a picture.
10. **Basic Calculator**: A GUI-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
- install Pillow 
- install pyglet
